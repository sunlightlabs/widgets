  <h3>About Politiwidgets</h3>
  <p>
    You should be able to insert information on a member of Congress into a blog post as easily as you can embed a video. These free widgets can help you display lawmakers' top campaign contributors, earmarks they have requested, their voting record on any current bill, where their fundraisers are, and much more!
